# COVID-19

This is a project of the analysis of the growth rates of COVID-19 throughout various counties in the USA. There are unfortunately too many variables to account for and many of them are not trackable, but this was an attempt to analytically analyze the data of covid 19. If given more resources and data this would be an incredible study.
